Baki, practice makes perfect, toh try karte rehna.\n\nKebabs ka secret, ab yeh toh bataunga. Kebabs banane ke liye sabse zaroori hai, ke marinade ko time dena. Chicken ya paneer ko achhi tarah se marinate karna aur use time dene se kebabs ko bahut flavor milta hai. Iske alawa, grilled karne se pehle seekh ko ekdum thoda ghee ya oil se brush karna hai.

Which one do you prefer, Chicken or Paneer Kathi Rolls?\n\n- Ah, that's a tough choice, yaar! But if I had to pick, I'd say Paneer Kathi Rolls for me, any day.

Have you tried making Aloo Tikki at home, kya secret ingredient aap use karte hain?\n\n- Haan, I've tried making Aloo Tikki at home many times. My secret ingredient is a pinch of cumin seeds – it adds a nice earthy flavour to the Aloo Tikki.\n\n5.
